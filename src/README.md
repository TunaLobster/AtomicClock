A fairly basic WWVB clock for Arduino (ATMega 328P).

Credit for the heavy lifting of decoding the AM signal goes to ahooper/WWBVClock. I have updated for currently available parts and have a few more features planned.

**TODO:**

- [ ] Store UTC on the RTC and use UTC to local convertor
- [ ] Encode century minutes to WWVB time code (for a side project)
